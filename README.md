# Project -  Social Listening for Public Outrage
Team - Shreya Shukla, Ram Potham, Adeniyi Joseph, Diana Rivera

Code for Compassion London 2025

Project Idea - Use natural language processing (NLP) to monitor media, social feeds, and news for moments of public outrage about factory farming (e.g., scandals, environmental damage, disease outbreaks) and send real-time alerts to the comms team to amplify.

Used n8n (https://n8n.io/) for workflow.
